# AdaptiMod
AI-powered content moderation using GFU/GFD principles.
Core Features
Q(A)-Driven Moderation:
Entropy (H): Measures content diversity (e.g., novel topics, user-generated creativity).
Information (I): Tracks compliance with safety guidelines (e.g., hate speech filters, spam detection).
Q(A) Thresholds:
High Q(A): Too much risk (e.g., rising harmful content) → Compression Mode (stricter filters).
Low Q(A): Overly restrictive → Expansion Mode (allow more diverse content).
Real-Time Dashboard:
Visualizes Q(A) trends, flagged content, and moderation actions.
Customizable alerts for Q(A) breaches (e.g., "Risk spike detected in Politics category").
Automated Workflows:
Risk Pods: Isolate high-risk content for human review.
Stability Tokens: Automatically approve low-risk content.
Audit & Compliance:
Generate reports linking Q(A) metrics to moderation decisions for regulatory transparency.

How It Works
Integration: Plug into platforms via API (e.g., WordPress, Discord, Shopify).
Training: Customize Q(A) thresholds based on platform risk tolerance.

# Simplified pseudocode
if calculate_Q_A(current_content) > threshold:
    enable_stricter_filters()
    flag_for_human_review()
else:
    allow_content()
    log_as_low_risk()


Why It’s Simple & Scalable
Low-Code Setup: Pre-trained GFU models for common use cases (e.g., social media, e-commerce).
Pay-Per-Q(A) Pricing: Charge based on Q(A) analysis volume (e.g., $0.01 per 1k Q(A) calculations).
Vertical SaaS Potential: Adapt to niches like gaming (toxic chat moderation) or healthcare (HIPAA-compliant patient forums).

Example Use Case
Scenario: A social media platform notices rising misinformation.
AdaptiMod Response:
Detects Q(A) spike → Activates Compression Mode (fact-checking bots, reduced post visibility).
Post-crisis → Shifts to Expansion Mode (relax filters, encourage user engagement).
